Here are the current projects in this repository:

- **Project 1**: Object Detection on COCO Dataset using YOLO-NAS
- **Project 2**: Real-time Object Detection using YOLOv5 and OpenCV
- **Project 3**: Object Detection on Custom Dataset using YOLOv5
- **Project 4**: violence detection api

## Requirements

The following are the general requirements for running the projects in this repository:

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- OpenCV 4.2+
- CUDA 10.2+ (for GPU acceleration)

Additional requirements may be listed in each project's directory.
